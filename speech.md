[slide 1]

How is it going?

[slide 2]

My name is Erik Galloway and I am a computer programmer for a company called Flip Learning.

[slide 3]

What is computer programmer. 

- It is about helping people and making the world a better place.
- Solving problems for people
- Building and making new cool technology and stuff like...
- Computer Programs or Software, Applications, Websites, Artificial Intelligence or AI


And I get to work with my buddy Reggie...

[slide 4]

What is like to be a computer programmer

- People think I am really smart
- I get to help people
- I get to make the world a better and more efficient place
- And the real reason I love it is because I get to work from home and hangout with my buddy Reggie all day.

[slide 5]

Well.. I work he sleeps most of the time.

He didn't want me to show you this picture.. but do you guys want to see a funny one of how he sleeps sometimes..

[slide 6]


Ok... How many of you like play video games? Great.. So I personally like to play Xbox but.. 

[slide 7]

I've been wondering which one is better.. Xbox or Playstation?

Great.. Who thinks they have an idea for a game that has never been done before?

Awesome, because... Computers can be programmed to make games and both the Xbox and Playstation are computers.. 

Just like my laptop right here. They all have the same parts in them.

A.. 
- Hard Drive
- Central Processing Unit or CPU
- Random Access Memory or RAM
- Graphics Card
- And more...

But that means you could create a game for an Xbox or Playstation.


Ok, one more question.. How many of you have cell phones.. I have an Iphone

[slide 8]

So do we like iPhones better or Android phones better?

...

Did you guys ever have an idea for an app or game? 

Because these are computers too.. And just like an Xbox or Playstation.. 
You can program them to create and run an app or game.

[slide 9]

So we know if we want to be a programmer we get to work with computers.

[slide 10]

I have another question... Do you think computers are smart or dumb?

[slide 11]

Computers are actually dumb... For a computer to run they need to be told exactly what to do and when.

And thats what I do as a computer programmer. I tell the computer what to do by writing computer code.

This computer code is in different computer languages that the computer reads and translates to a 0 or a 1.

When you string a bunch of Ones and Zeros together... You get the language a computer uses...

So who is ready for an experiment?


Ok so who likes food?

What about Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.. 

Me too and I'm hungry right now so for our experiment... 

You guys are going to tell me how to make a PB and J so I can eat it.and then I'm going to act like a computer and go through your steps like a computer would.

Each step is like a line of computer code. 

1. Open Bag wrong end
2. Get 2 slices out
3. Apply PB
4. Apply Jelly
5. Put together wrong way
6. Eat it

---

So that didn't go exactly as planned did it?

All of the problems we had like when I put together the sandwich the wrong way is an example of a computer bug.

What I do as a computer programmer is after I write the first code sort of like you guys di... I test it and then go back and fix
the problems until it is perfect.

[slide 12]

So what do i do exactly?

- I create web applications that make learning fun and interactive on a computer.. 
 
- I also create websites, apps and games.

[slide 13] 

This is the application I created for the my work that makes learning fun..

[slide 14]

And I even created a game for you guys... Who thinks they can beat my high score...
