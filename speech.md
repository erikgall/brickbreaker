How is it going?

### Slide 2

![Slide 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide2.jpg)

### Slide 3

![Slide 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide3.jpg)

Who can tell me what a computer programmer is?

So a computer programmer is and does..

Being a programemr is about helping people and making the world a better place by solving problems using technology.

To solve problems you a programmer will build and create/programs things such as:
1. Software/Programs
2. Apps
3. Websites
4. Robots
5. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Slide 4

![Slide 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide4.jpg)

What is it like to be computer programmer/me?

- People think I am really smart
- I get to help people
- I get to make the world a better and more efficient place
- I get to build cool things for fun.
- And the real reason I love it is because I get to work from home and hangout with my buddy Reggie all day.

### Slide 5

![Slide 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide5.jpg)

Well.. I work he sleeps most of the time....

Do you guys want to see a picture of how he sleeps sometimes?

He told me never to show anyone this picture... Sorry Reggie.


### Slide 6

![Slide 6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide6.jpg)

Ok... So who here likes to play video games? Nice..  I do too... I like play Xbox..

So I've got a question for you guys that I've been wondering... 

### Slide 7

![Slide 7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide7.jpg)

Xbox or Playstation.

Great.. Who thinks they have an idea for a game that has never been done before?

Awesome, did you guys know that an Xbox and Playstation are both computers...

Just like my laptop right here. They all have the same parts in them.

A.. 
- Hard Drive
- Motherboard
- Graphics Card

But if you are a computer programmer and can program computers..
 
That means you can create a game for an Xbox or Playstation by using what you know about programming.

Ok, one more question.. How many of you have cell phones.. I have an Iphone

### Slide 8

![Slide 8](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide8.jpg)

So do we like iPhones better or Android phones better?

...

Did you guys ever have an idea for an app or game? 

Cellphones are computers too.. 

And just like an Xbox or Playstation.. 

You can program them to create and run an app or game.

### Slide 9

![Slide 9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide9.jpg)

So we know if we want to be a programmer we get to work with computers.

### Slide 10

![Slide 10](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide10.jpg)

I have another question... Do you think computers are smart or dumb?

### Slide 11

![Slide 11](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide11.jpg)

Computers are actually dumb... For a computer to run they need to be told exactly what to do and when.

And thats what I do as a computer programmer. I tell the computer what to do by writing computer code.

This computer code is in different computer languages that the computer reads and translates to a 0 or a 1.

When you string a bunch of Ones and Zeros together... You get the language a computer uses...

So who is ready for an experiment?


Ok so who likes food?

What about Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.. 

Me too and I'm hungry right now so for our experiment... 

You guys are going to tell me how to make a PB and J so I can eat it.and then I'm going to act like a computer and go through your steps like a computer would.

Each step is like a line of computer code. 

**Basic steps you should receive**

1. Open Bag (rip open from wrong end)
2. Get 2 slices of bread out
3. Apply PB (way too much PB)
4. Apply Jelly (way too much jelly)
5. Put together (wrong way, w/ PB & J on outside)
6. Eat it

*Write them on the board and have them read the off to you before you do each step*

---

So that didn't go exactly as planned did it?

All of the problems we had like when I put together the sandwich the wrong way is an example of a computer bug.

What I do as a computer programmer is after I write the first code sort of like you guys di... I test it and then go back and fix
the problems until it is perfect.

### Slide 12

![Slide 12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide12.jpg)

So what do I do exactly?

- I create web applications that make learning fun and interactive on a computer.. 
 
- I also create websites, apps and games.

### Slide 13

![Slide 13](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide13.jpg)

This is the application I created for the my work that makes learning fun..

### Slide 14

![Slide 14](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/erikgall/career-day/master/slides/slide14.jpg)

And I even created a game for you guys... 

Have you guys ever heard of the game Brick Breaker..

Who thinks they can beat my high score... My high score is 17 (one kid got 18 and one kid got 17) so 17 seemed like a perfect number to pick.
